Project Title :
soccer hangman game
this game is a simple guessing game hangman style you have 10 attempts at guessing the word thats displayed as empty underscores there's an alphabet displayed on the top of the screen where you pick a letter by clicking on it with your mouse clicker. If you guess a letter correctly then the letter appears on the underscore if you guess a wrong letter you lose one of your attempts. You can't pick the same letter more than once, so if you keep clicking on the same letter nothing happens. Once you complete the word the picture of the team displayed in the words will pop up if you lose all 10 attempts then you'll get a game over screen. Once the game is over simply refresh the screen to get a new word to play again.
